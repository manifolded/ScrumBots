# ScrumBots

## Installing IronPython

To configure this project you will need to install IronPython (IP).  This has been tested with IP version 2.7.8.

  1. To install, first open the ScrumBots in Unity and create a directory `Assets/Plugins/Resources`.  This directory is where all the IP .dll and .xml files will go.
  
  2. Download and unpack IronPython from [here](http://ironpython.net/).
  
  3. From the `IronPython.2.7.8/net45` directory copy `IronPython.*` and `Microsoft.*` into `Assets/Plugins/Resources`.  This can be most easily accomplished by drag-and-dropping the files to the Unity project window.  This will allow Unity to import them.
